        <div class="content"><h1>Notations in Indian Classical Music</h1>
          <br><br>
          <p>In Hindustani (North Indian) classical music, we divide an octave into 12 notes. We use a movable scale, which means that your octave can start anywhere you like. Your starting point is the tonic (called "sa" and denoted by "S"), and all the other notes are defined in relation to sa. For notation purposes, each of the 12 notes in an octave has a unique identity, given by S, r, R, g, G, m, M, P, d, D, n, N.
          </p><br>
          <p>Keyboard instruments are not really suited to Indian music because they are equally tempered and have fixed pitches (Indian music is based on pure intonation and uses a lot of gliding between the notes). However, keyboards do make it very easy to explain and visualize music. <br>
          </p><br><p>So here goes. Pick any key on the keyboard as your sa. Then play 12 consecutive keys in ascending order including both blacks and whites to get all the 12 notes in an octave.

          <br><p>Here are a couple of illustrations using the keys C and B♭ as sa. (The octave ends at N, but we always complete it by singing the sa of the next octave, and that is why the illustrations show thirteen notes).

            <div class=text>Table 1 Notes in an Octave in Hindustani Music</div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Let me explain some of the columns in Table 1 above. If you compare the Notation ID and Solfa Syllable columns, you will find that the notes r and R are both re; g and G are both ga; m and M are both ma; d and D are both dha; and n and N are both ni. Then moving to the Note Name column, you will find that these notes are modified by adjectives, shuddha (natural), komal (flat), or tivra (sharp). The notes re, ga, dha, and ni each have natural and flat variants, while the note ma has a natural and a sharp variant. What this means is that these five notes can be sung in one of two ways - either natural, or flat/sharp in relation to the natural. The video below demonstrates the difference between the natural and flat/sharp variants of each note. In each case, the natural variant is sung first followed by the flat or sharp variant. I use C as my tonic (sa) and have color-coded the natural notes red, the flat notes pink, and the sharp note maroon.</p>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8-pubGyccFI?el=0&start=40&wmode=opaque" loading="lazy" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen height="300" width="500"></iframe><br>
            <div class=text> Natural vs. flat/sharp variants of all the notes</div><br>
            <p>The notes S and P, called sa and pa, have only one variant each. This is because sa and pa form the backbone of the octave and always have a precise pitch relation to each other. If you sing sa at a certain pitch, then the pitch of pa gets fixed by this and that is the only pitch at which it can be sung. In total, therefore, there are seven distinct notes in an octave - sa re ga ma pa dha ni. These are called swar.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The "Notation ID" column gives you the names of the notes as they are used in musical notation. As noted above, with the exception of sa and pa, all the other notes (re, ga, ma, dha, and ni) have two notation IDs each. The lower frequency note is denoted by a small letter and the higher frequency note is denoted by a capital letter to distinguish between the two variants. The final sa in Table 1 belongs to the next octave and is notated S', with a quotation mark after it. Notes in octaves below or above your basic octave are notated with quotation marks before or after them to show which octave they belong to. Here is an illustration using C as sa.</p>

            <div class="text"> Entire keyboard notated using C as sa </div>
            </div><br>
            <p>The third column gives the Indian solfa syllables for the various notes. We call solfa "sargam," an acronym created by combining the first four syllables (sa re ga ma). Singing in sargam is not just for voice training in Indian classical music – it is also used as part of musical performance, as one of the tools for improvisation.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In the performance below, Venkatesh Kumar sings in sargam between 9:10 to 11:15 or so.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The full names of the notes are <i>shadja, rishabha, gandhara, madhyama, panchama, dhaivata, and nishada.</i></p>
                <br><br>
                <h1>The Natural Origin of Notes</h1>
                <p>Musical notes correspond to certain frequencies (pitches) relative to the tonic (sa). These are frequencies at which the sound produced is clear and pleasing because it is consonant (i.e., in agreement) with the tonic. At other frequencies, the sound is dissonant (clashes with the tonic). The tonic is played constantly in the background in musical cultures that use a drone (or something like the tanpura in Indian music), but even when it is not physically played, it is present in our minds as we listen to music. The way our minds make sense of music is by being aware of the tonic and understanding the other notes in relation to it. Therefore, the pitches that are pleasing to hear are those that are consonant, and it is these pitches that are traditionally used for music by all cultures.</p>
                <br> 
                <p>The video below has to do with vibrations, frequencies, and resonance. It will help you visualize what happens when you find a frequency that is consonant with the tonic, and why there are only some pitches that are pleasing while others are not.</p>
