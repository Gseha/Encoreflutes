                <p><b>Ornamentation in Indian Classical Music (alankar)</b></p>
                <br><br><br>
                <p>If you have a simple melody that can stand on its own, ornamentation is what is added to this to make it more appealing. There are many different kinds of ornaments (alankar) in Indian classical music. Some add finer nuances to the melody, others give it texture. Together, the various ornaments play a very important role in giving body and expressiveness to a simple melody, making it complete in and of itself without the need for accompaniment.
                <br>
                    This page introduces some of the main ornaments used in Indian classical and semi-classical music. For convenience, I focus on vocal music, but all of the ornaments below apply to instrumental music too.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h1>Kan-swar</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Notes can be sung straight, but they are often sung with kan-swar (grace notes; literally "a small quantity of a note") borrowed from an adjacent note in a musical phrase.<br>
                </p><br>
                <p>A grace note is when you play a note for a very short time compared with other notes - it is a flicker of that note. You literally tap the hole of the note - on and off very quickly. For example, you could play : S R G (R) G - The (R) is the grace note. So when you play this sequence of notes you will play Sa Re Ga then you will tap your finger on and off the grace note, in this case the Re hole very quickly, then playing Ga normally. The idea here is that it must not sound long like the other notes, it must be very very short - remember just a tap! Try to play the grace notes in the following Alankaar practice exercises remembering to tap your finger very quickly on the notes in brackets:</p>
                <br>
                <p>S (N) S        R (S) R       G (R) G       M (G) M<br>

                    SRG (R) G       RGM (G) M       GMP (M) P<br>
                    
                    SG (R) G R       RM (G) M G       GP (M) P M<br>
                    
                    SG (R) GRS       RM (G) MGR       GP (M) PMG<br>
                    
                    SRGRG (R) GR       RGMGM (G) MG       GMPMP (M) PM<br>
                    
                    SRG (R) GRS       RGM (G) MGR       GMP (M) PMG<br>
                    
                    S ('D) S     R (S) R     G (R) G     P (G) P     D (P) D     S' (D) S'<br>
                    
                    S' (D) S'     D (P) D     P (G) P     G (R) G     R (S) R     S ('D) S</p>
                <br>
                <br><br>
                <h1>MEEND (Glissando)</h1>
                <br>
                <p>In its simplest form, a meend is a smooth glide from one note to another. During slower parts of a melody, kan-swars also become meends. However, meends can span much longer intervals too. Although a meend spanning a distance of several notes technically includes all the intermediate frequencies, only selected frequencies are given enough prominence as to be identified clearly.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Meend is when you go from one note to the other, for example from Ni to Sa in a sliding motion with your finger. This creates a continuous, flowing sound. If you were to play Ni and then Sa normally, there would be a short gap between the notes and the notes would sound separate. However, by using meend, we can make notes join without having a gap. This is done in 2 ways; 1. by sliding your finger very slowly in an upwards motion (I do this in the video below) or 2. by lifting up your finger tip very slowly. To do meend from Ni to Sa, play Ni and then slowly move your finger upwards until uncovering it completely. </p>
                <br><br><br>
                <h1>Gamak</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Gamak is a word used to describe the sound of a drum; the vibration that happens when you strike the drumhead. As a musical ornament, it is a technique of singing a note with force in a way that creates a vibration, which adds a new dimension or texture to the music. In practice, the percussive effect of a gamak can be heard most effectively when several notes in succession are sung with force using a vowel sound at a brisk, even pace. Different kinds of gamak are possible in terms of the intensity and wavelength of the vibration and the quality of voice used.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The general term "gamak" means ornament and more precisely, it consists of beginning each note from above in a curved, sliding pattern - almost as if you were caressing the hole. It is similar to meend but much faster, so instead of going from one note to the next very slowly and continuing the sound, gamak is made by moving your finger up and down over a note as if caressing that note.</p>
                <br>
                <p>'P 'D 'N S R G R S 'N 'D 'P and 'P'P 'D'D 'N'N SS RR GG RR SS 'N'N 'D'D 'P</p>
                <br><br><br>
                <h1>Khatka</h1><br>
                <p>A khatka is an ornament that involves performing a single note as a cluster of notes. The main note is featured most prominently, but a neighboring note or two are included as well. The main note is the note that can be sung straight in place of the khatka without affecting the underlying structure of the melody. Khatkas are very common, but their application is far from random. Different notes in different ragas lend themselves to the use of khatka, but not all the time. Experience teaches you when and on which notes a khatka sounds appropriate.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When a cluster of notes played very fast and with force to decorate or embellish another note, it is called a khatka or gitkari. Say for example, R S 'N S….R where the cluster, R S 'N S embellishes R and is applied very swiftly.</p>
                <br>
              <p> It is similar to kan (see above) also because you tap the notes very very quickly. Take the example above  'D 'N 'D 'P 'D--------  playing the 'D 'N 'D 'P swiflty.</p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h1>Andolan</h1><br>
            <p>An andolan is a slow oscillation applied to a note. It usually features in ragas that use microtones and is applied to the notes in those ragas that involve the use of microtones. Microtones are unstable pitches that fall between two notes and are difficult to sustain. Artists can use this natural instability to their advantage by mastering the andolan and oscillating the note in a controlled fashion, rather like a graceful tight-rope walker.</p>
            <BR>
                <P>Andolan, meaning oscillation is the swing or oscillation that starts from a fixed note and touches the periphery of an adjacent note. It is produced on the bansuri in a similar way to the meend technique.</P>

                    <P><B>Ornaments Used Mainly in Semi-Classical Music</B></P>
                    <BR>
                        <P>Some ornaments like murki and zamzama are very characteristic of Indian folk music and semi-classical forms of music that are influenced by or recently evolved from folk music, such as dadra, thumri, tappa and so on. They do also feature in mainstream classical music, but only very rarely.</P>
                        <BR><bR>
                        <H1>Murki</H1>
                        <BR>
                           <P>A murki is very much like a trill in that it usually involves two or three neighboring notes being alternated very swiftly and lightly. In fast-paced folk-derived compositions, murkis are rendered to sound light and sharp. In slower, more sensuous compositions, such as the thumri, they are smoothed over a bit, to sound more languid than sharp.</P>
                        <BR>
                            <p>A murki is a cluster of usually 2-3 notes played around a main note to make it sound more beautiful. A combination like R R S 'N S-- could be a murki or a khatka or the starting point of a zamzama (see below), depending on the force of delivery. What distinguishes murki is that it is played relatively slowly and softly in comparison to khatka and zamzama which are more forceful, however it will be played faster than the main notes.
                                <br>You can make up any combination of notes, using notes around the main note you wish to express (The main note is SA in this example), for example; G---R S 'N S------------ (This sounds more beautiful than just playing SA so the idea here is to play a cluster of notes in order to end with the main note).
                               <br> An example coming to the main note Dha = 'D 'N 'D 'P 'D</p>
                               <br><Br><br>
                         <h1>Zamzama</h1>           
                         <br><p>A zamzama is an unevenly accented sequence of notes sung using sharp gamaks. The length of the notes in the sequence also varies, giving it a choppy effect. This ornament is very characteristic of folk music in the western parts of India, and also of a genre of semi-classical music called tappa which evolved from folk songs sung by camel riders in Punjab.</p>
                         <br>
                         <P>Zamzama is an urdu word meaning ‘addition of notes’. Like a khatka, it is once again a cluster of notes, used to embellish the landing note. Unlike a khatka, notes in a zamzama are played in progressive combinations and permutations (like very fast ordered note clusters or taans). The end result sounds like a complex taan pattern with sharp gamaks. It is difficult to produce and requires a lot of practice.
                           <br> Basically the difference between khatka and zamzama is that khatka only hits 1-3 notes, whereas Zamzamas continue up and down the scale. This ornamentation moves so fast that it seems more like a texture than a line, almost as if you are painting up and down with a paintbrush to make the music sound beautiful.
                            <br>To put it more simply, zamzama is a series of khatkas woven together, for example:
