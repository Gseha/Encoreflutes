                <h1 id="WhichFluteToBuy">Which Flute to Buy?</h1>
                <br>

                <p>Well the simple answer to this question is that you can buy any flute!
                    The thing is that you should be able to hold the flute properly without any air gaps and the flute should be well tuned as well..
                </p>
                    <p>  If you are an adult then we recommend G# or A Major flute to you since they have a bigger size suitable to adult hands...
                    Being an adult if you are not comfortable to hold these flutes, then you can pay a visit to a nearby flute shop and buy a flute that you can hold easily...
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> If you are a kid or a teenager, then probably you should buy C Medium or C# Medium flute. Since these flutes have a small size, they are comfortableto be held by a kid.
                    Being a Kid if you are not comfortableto hold these flutes then you can choose G# or G Medium or even anopther flute that fits in your hands...
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>The link to buy best flutes for Beginners, Intermediates and Professionals is given in the <u>Buy Flute</u> section, or you can <a href="brightbansuri......,\bansuriBuyFlutes.html"> click here</a>to reach that tab </i>
                    </p><br>
                   <p> But the question here arises, how do we know that <B>Are We Holding The Flute Correctly?</B> and <B>Is the Flute Well-Tuned?</B>
                  </p>
                <h1 id="HoldingFlute"> How to Hold a Flute Correctly?</h1>
                <p>Different people have different ways of gripping the flute. The only thing that you should keep in mind is that you should be comfortable while holding the instrument.</p>
                <br>
                <p>If you have only just begun to play the bansuri, you may be unsure how to hold the flute. If you are right handed then you will use your left hand to cover the top 3 holes and your right hand will be used on the bottom of the flute. If you are left handed, you will do the opposite. In the pictures below, you will see that one player is left handed and the other right.</p>
                <br>
                <p>There are 2 main ways of gripping the bansuri.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hariprasad Chaurasia's style</li><br>
                    <img src="hpc_hires2.jpg" height="451px" width="640px">
                    <p>The pads of the fingers are used to cover the holes - not the finger tips. The fingers are relaxed and flat.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Observe the position of the fingers. Notice also the position of the thumbs. The thumbs help to support the bansuri and keep it in position. The chin also helps do this. The fingers must be able to dance over the holes and therefore should not be used to support the flute - Use the thumbs and the chin to do this.</p>
                    <img src="Picture 1.png" class="imgright"><br>
                    <p>The little finger (or pinkie) is not used and does not need to touch the flute. The others fingers cover the holes and the thumbs help keep the flute in place without slipping.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>When playing in this style, keep in mind that the lines on your fingers should not be over the holes as this will cause the air to leak and effect the sound (See picture to the right). You will notice that if you cover a hole and there is a slight gap, the sound will be squeaky or non existent, so it is important to ensure you cover the holes correctly.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <li>Pannalal Ghosh's style </li><br>
                    <img src="Picture5.png"><br>
                    <p>The finger tips are used to cover holes (as in picture below). This style can be difficult for players with small hands and fingers, particularly on the larger flutes.</p>
                    <br><img src="Picture 2.png" style="float: right;"><br><br>
                    <p>Some players use this style of the smaller flutes and Hariprasad Chaurasia's stule on the larger flutes.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Observe how in the picture opposite Pannalal Ghosh is using the very tips of his fingers to close holes.</p>
                </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>Practice the grip that is most comfortable for you WITHOUT making any sounds.
                        Just get used to the feel of the flute and where the holes are.
                        Notice how your thumbs can be positioned to support the flute. Examine the pictures here and try to copy.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When you begin playing, it is normal to experience some discomfort in your hands, fingers and thumb.</p>
                    <p>It takes time for your hands and fingers to adjust - it can take years to be able to play the larger flutes comfortably. If you are a total beginner, it is best to begin using a smaller flute such as an A bass flute, G bass flute or if you have very small hands a C medium flute (See where to buy a bansuri for more information on selecting a suitable flute). </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Once you get used to this, you can then move down to a bigger flute and begin to adapt to that also. 
                        If you are experiencing discomfort, I would recommend stretching your fingers before playing the flute and after. Shake your hands if they begin to ache. Give yourself breaks also and above all if you are experiencing a lot of pain, give yourself a break for a day or 2. Do not overdo it. Just practice a little at a time.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h1 id="Well-Tuned">How to find whether a Flute is Well-Tuned?</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>Someone who learns classical music or Bansuri for a ample amount of time, could easily tell whether a flute is well tuned or not. They listen to the frequencies produced by the flute and then quickly match it with the frequencies of Sa Re Ga ma. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>But it is also a matter of concern that if we cannot find such Music experts then How would we able to make sure whether our Bansuri is well-tuned or not?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Not being classically trained either, I found it difficult at first to distinguish between various frequencies since Re of my C Middle Bansuri sounded same as the Sa of my D Middle Bansuri.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Then, an app called <B>Swar Alap</B> came to my rescue. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.swar.alap&hl=en_IN&gl=US">Click Here</a> to download the app.
                        <br> By Using the app I understood that Sa and Re of my two different Bansuries were actually the same note.We will learn the rason behind it in <a href="What are flute scale.htm">What are flute scales?Which is the best?</a>section</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In order to find whether our Flute is well-tuned or not we need to find its Scale</p><br>
                    <div style="background-color: white; display: inline-table; padding: 10px; border: 2px solid black; width:inherit;">
                    <h1 id="ScaleFinding">How to Find Scale of our Bansuri?</h1>
                    <p>Open Swar Alap App, and Start playing Sa by closing the first three holes of the Bansuri.<br>
                    Notice the Notation visible on the top. Here, I am getting C5<br>
                    Hence the Scale of my Bansuri is C.</p>
                    <img src="C5.jpg"  height="160" width="310">
                    </div><br>
                    <p>We simply have to set the scale of our Bansuri on the Scale Menu Dropdown list.<br>
                    Next, We have to play Sa Re Ga Ma on flute .</p><img src="Dropdown.jpg" class="imgright" height="400" width="100">
                    <p><br><I>If you don't know how to play SaReGaMa, Please check our <A href="Beginning To Play SaReGaMa.html">Beginning to Play SaReGaMa</A>Section</I> 
                    <br>If it is well-tuned, then if we play a note ,let Sa, the the frequency line in the App would touch the axis line of Sa.</p>              
                    <br>
                    <p>We need to check whether all the notes match the correct frequency or not.</p>
                    <br>
                    <img src="Image20210415165143.jpg" height="180" width="300" style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;">
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Next we need to play Pa by closing all the holes. Note the English Notation that appears at the top.</p>
                    <br><br><br><br><br><br>
                    <img src="Gs.jpg" height="180" width="300" style=" float:right; padding-right: 10px;">
                    <p>Here, I get the note G#, hence I set my scale to G# .Please reset the scale according to the notation you recieved.</p>
                    <br> <br><br><br><br>
                    <p>Now play the flute by opening one hole at a time from the last with all holes closed to all holes opened.</p>
                    <img src="saregama Gs.jpg" height="180" width="300" style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;">
                    <br><br>
                    <p>See if it matches the frequencies of Sa Re Ga Ma as you play it.If the frequencies match both the way, then ur flute is Well-Tuned. Congrats!</p>
                    <br>
